<a href="https://launchpad.net/ubuntu-html5-theme">Ubuntu HTML5 Theme</a> is a collection of javascript and CSS files for creating HTML5 application, that look like native Ubuntu Touch applications. These HTML5/Javascript applications are deployed using <a href="http://daniel-beck.org/ubuntu-html5-theme/basics/apache-cordova/">Apache Cordova</a> on handheld devices


Its <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License">GNU LGPL v3</a> license allows it to be used in closed-source commercial applications, as long as the changes made to Ubuntu HTML5 Theme are redistributed under the same license.
