<a href="http://physalis.io">Physalis Build Cloud</a> is open for everyone! Physalis is an opensource build 
cloud for Apache Cordova (TM) projects. It's licensed under the MIT-license and written in scala.

<a href="https://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova (TM)</a> allows creating apps with HTML5 while also
accessing native device capabilities, such as the accelerometer, GPS
contact list, etc. This is made possible with a multi-platform
JavaScript-to-Native bridge technology.

Physalis Build Cloud makes developing with Apache Cordova much easier:
given the source code from a public Git repository, Physalis builds and
packs the app for several platforms. There is no need to install and
configure an SDK.

For the moment, ubuntu and android are supported. Other platforms and
functionalities will follow.
