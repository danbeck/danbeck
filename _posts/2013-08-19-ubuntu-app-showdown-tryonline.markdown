Further progresses have been made to the RamSamSam Reader:
<ul>
	<li>Some UI changes: feeds and feed-entries can be scrolled individually. The header has a fixed position. This makes RamSamSam Reader feel more like a native app.</li>
	<li>UI updates for the article view and the feed list</li>
</ul>
RamSamSam reader can be tried online here: <a title="RamSamSam Reader" href="http://daniel-beck.org/rss">http://daniel-beck.org/rss/</a>
