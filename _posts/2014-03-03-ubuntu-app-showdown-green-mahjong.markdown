A new Ubuntu App Showdown <a href="http://developer.ubuntu.com/2014/02/announcing-the-latest-ubuntu-app-showdown-contest/">was announced</a>. The Ubuntu App Showdown is a competition where contestants have six weeks to build and publish an app. It is an opportunity to get in touch with exiting new Ubuntu developments. Above all, it is a fun way to learn new technologies. 

The theme of this competition is China and the Chinese culture. The app that we will build is a solitaire mahjongg game named "Green Mahjong". 

The source of the app can be found on gitorious: https://gitorious.org/green-mahjong

Also, as a little appetizer, here one mahjong tile:
