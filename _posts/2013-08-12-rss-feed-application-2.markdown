I'm participating to the Ubuntu App Showdown <a href="https://plus.google.com/s/%23ubuntuappshowdown">#ubuntuappshowdown</a> which started yesterday.  My goal is to write an RSS feed Reader in HTML5.

I plan to implement the following features::

* Offline reading
* Day/Night modus</li>
* Synchronisation with cloud services lik _Feedly_, and _The Old Reader_
* ebay feeds
* Sharing RSS Feeds with friends
* Favorite Feed entries</li>
