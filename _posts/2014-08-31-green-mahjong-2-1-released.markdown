Green Mahjong 2.1 includes many improvements. 

New layouts
-----------

We added two board layouts: "bug" and "four hills":

<strong>Game statistics, points and achievement system</strong>
Green Mahjong 2.1 introduces points. Solving a board gives you a bonus. There is also a
time bonus for solving a game under 8 minutes:

<strong>New menu</strong>
The old menu appeared and disappeared when the player touched the background. This was suboptimal because 1) new gamers would not discover the menu immediately 2) it sometimes gets in the way while playing. Green Mahjong 2.1 implemenents a new game menu which is much more userfriendly and still doesn't cost much screen estate: 


<strong>Improved visuals: hints</strong>
The hint function is now much faster on slower devices and even looks much better. In the preceding version, we used CSS filters to grey out the blocked tiles - version 2.1 uses hand tuned sprites. The result looks much better:

<strong>Many speed improvements on old devices</strong>

 * much less dom manipulation
 * hints are realized with sprites instead of CSS filter

The game can be played in the browser, too: <a href="http://greenmahjong.daniel-beck.org"><strong>Green Mahjong</strong></a>
