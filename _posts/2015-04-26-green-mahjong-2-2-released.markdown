This new release of Green Mahjong is very exciting: we worked hard at porting Green Mahjong on many more platforms.

 
Until now, Green Mahjong was available on _Ubuntu touch_, _FirefoxOS_, _Firefox_ and _Chrome_. With release 2.2, we added
the following platforms:

- Android: [Green Mahjong][LinkToGooglePlay]
- Iphone: [Green Mahjong][LinkToIphoneStore]
- Jolla

Here is the full changelog:

- added chinese translation
- support for browser back
- new toolbar button for switching themes
- removed a bug which made tiles not selectable under the toolbar.
- Added _Android_, _iPhone_ and _Jolla_ to the list of supported platforms.
