Green Mahjong has just been published in the <a href="https://marketplace.firefox.com/app/green-mahjong">Firefox Marketplace</a>. 

Green Mahjong is a solitaire mahjong game where the user must find matching pairs of mahjong tiles. The game is released under GPLv3, the artwork under CC BY-NC license. 

The game comes with two themes "fruits" and "classic" (see the picture below). The game artwork looks good on all devices (phones, tablets, desktop...) since it comes in several resolutions.

The game can  also be tried out here: <a href="http://daniel-beck.org/greenmahjong">Green Mahjong</a>.

Here are screenshots:
