Hi developers of HTML5 apps! 

In 2013, I created an unofficial API reference documentation for the Ubuntu HTML5 Theme. This API reference is outdated now and many example may not run anymore. Additionaly, a officila Ubuntu HTML5 documentation exists now.

The link is still available here for historic purporses: <a href="http://daniel-beck.org/ubuntu-html5-theme/">API documentation</a>.
