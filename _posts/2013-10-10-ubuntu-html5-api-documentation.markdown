Hi developers of HTML5 apps! 

In 2013, no good documentation was available for Ubuntu HTML5. Therefore, I created an 
unofficial "API reference"-like documentation which is quite outdated today. 
Fortunately, Canonical created a very nice [Ubuntu HTML5 API Documentation] [UbuntuHTML5API].

The link to my own documentation effort is available here: [(Outdated) Ubuntu API documentation][MyUbuntuHTML5API].
