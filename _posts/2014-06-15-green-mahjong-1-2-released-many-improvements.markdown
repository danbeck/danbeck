Green Mahjong 1.2 was released today. The new version brings quite a few new features:

<h2>Hints</h2>
Green Mahjong has now a "hint" function - simply use the "Hint" button in the toolbar to see all possible moves:

<h2>Detection of a lost game</h2>
If there are no more possible moves - i.e. if the game is lost - the user is informed with a friendly message:

<h2>Many graphical improvements</h2> 

* The heuristic which chooses the best resolution sprites was improved, taking into account the browser viewport height
* The gaming board is centered on the screen
* The backgrounds have better resolutions
