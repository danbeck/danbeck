<h2>Overview</h2>

Progress bars are new HTML5 elements. Ubuntu HTML5 comes with CSS styling instructions to style them.


<h2>Markup declaration</h2>
Declaring progress bars is made as follows:

```html
<progress></progress>
```

<h2>Predefined CSS classes</h2>
<ul><li>bigger</li></ul>

The class bigger allows to create bigger progress bars:

```html
<progress class="bigger"></progress>
```
