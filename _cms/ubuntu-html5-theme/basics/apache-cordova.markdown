 <a href="http://cordova.apache.org/">Apache Cordova</a> is a platform to develop mobile applications with HTML and Javascript, and supports - beside Ubuntu Touch - many platforms like "Android", "IPhone", "Windows 8" and even "Tizen".
Here is a description of Apache Cordova from the project homepage:

<blockquote>Apache Cordova is a set of device APIs that allow a mobile app developer to access native device function such as the camera or accelerometer from JavaScript.</blockquote>

Technically, bundling HTML5 as a mobile application is done by executing a WebView (e.g. a Webkit-widget) with a native application wrapper. The WebView shows one web page (named index.html by default) that references whatever CSS, JavaScript, images, media files, which are necessary for it to run. 

Javascript API for camera or accelerometer are included in Apache Cordova. They are implemented natively for each platform and can be accessed with a cross-platform wrapper API.  This makes it possible to develop an application for several mobile platforms.
